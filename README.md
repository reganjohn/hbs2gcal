# hbs2gcal

HBS students subscribed to the LH calendar in iCal cannot typically export this calendar to an .ics file because of permissions issues. Some students (myself included) want to upload the LH calendar to their Google Calendar; but you cannot sync these two. 

hbs2gcal creates all of the LH calendar events into a single .ics file that can be uploaded to Google Calendar.

The user is presented with the option to display all event summaries that are added to the final .ics file. The user can also choose to only include events in 2015.
